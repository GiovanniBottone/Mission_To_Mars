# Mission_To_Mars

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to 'scrape' information from  multiple websites focused on Mars for Robin's web app. This project used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Scraped Websites:
